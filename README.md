## Description

This project is a decentralized checklist application built using **Solidity, Ethers.js, and React (Next.js)**.  
It allows users to manage a personal on-chain checklist connected to their wallet, ensuring all data is transparently stored and verifiable on the blockchain.

Each checklist item is stored inside a smart contract deployed on a blockchain network. Users interact with their tasks directly through MetaMask, ensuring full ownership and decentralized control over their data.

## Features

- ✅ **On-chain Checklist:** Tasks are stored permanently on the blockchain.
- 🔐 **Wallet Gated Access:** Only users with a connected wallet can interact.
- 📋 **Task Management:** Add tasks and mark them as completed.
- ⚡ **Live Blockchain Updates:** Updates list after every transaction.
- 🛡️ **Secure Smart Contract Integration:** Uses Ethers.js for contract interaction.
- 🔄 **Loading & Error Handling:** Proper user feedback for slow networks or failures.

## How It Solves

Traditional checklist apps:
- Depend on centralized servers  
- Can lose data or manipulate entries  
- Don’t truly give user ownership  

This decentralized solution solves those problems by:
- Storing tasks directly on the blockchain
- Allowing users to control their data through their wallet
- Ensuring transparency, immutability, and censorship resistance  

### Real World Use Cases
- Personal habit tracking  
- Blockchain-based task managers  
- Study or workout goal tracking  
- Proof-of-completion records  
- DAO contribution tasks  

By eliminating centralized control, this checklist empowers users with full data ownership while leveraging Web3 transparency.
